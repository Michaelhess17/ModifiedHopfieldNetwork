# ModifiedHopfieldNetwork 
### A Neural Analysis Tool for Networks of Real or Simulated Neurons
ModifiedHopfieldNetwork is a neural analysis tool that can be used to estimate mutual information between neurons in a real or simulated network, can compute the accuracy of stimulus prediction using maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) models trained on neural data with Hopfield Networks, or can conduct an analysis of changing functional connectivity through an experiment  by breaking the experiment into equally sized chunks and then conducting MI/MAP analyses.
